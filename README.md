#RECORDLY

##Completed
- Begin Angular app with seed project
- Setup skeleton html views: Home, Songs, Artists, Albums, Favorites (?)
- Add routes (models) for all views and controllers in app.js
- Add Bootstrap to make things pretty!
- Make input form work by adding scoped containers (and object) to controllers
- Use directives (ng-model) to bind form input to vars
- Implement scoped function that saves music metadata to arrays

##TODO
- Add database backend (Firebase) and prohibit dupe entries
- Complete html views for Songs, Artists, Albums
- Implement “Favorites” action/function
- User authentication using JS callbacks
- TDD! Don’t know how to unit test with Angular :'(
- Git branches for diff parts of app (e.g. songs, favorites)
- Share data between controllers and refactor using Angular services

##Best practices
- No extra indentation, return chars
- Add comments when useful
- Commit early and often!
- Screenreader classes in BS forms, etc. for accessibility
