- Setup skeleton html views
- Home, Songs, Artists, Albums, Favorites (?)
- Add routes (models) for all views and controllers in app.js
- Add Bootstrap to make things pretty!
- Make input form work by adding scoped containers (and object) to controllers
- Use directives (ng-model) to bind form input to vars
- Implement scoped function that saves music metadata to arrays

##TODO
- Add database backend (Firebase) and prohibit dupe entries
- Complete html views for Songs, Artists, Albums
- Implement “Favorites” with boolean object
