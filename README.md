#RECORDLY

##Completed
- Begin Angular app with seed project
- Setup skeleton html views: Home, Songs, Artists, Albums, Favorites (?)
- Add routes (models) for all views and controllers in app.js
- Add Bootstrap to make things pretty!
- Make input form work by adding scoped containers (and object) to controllers
- Use directives (ng-model) to bind form input to vars
- Implement scoped function that saves music metadata to arrays
- Firebase backend! Easy.
- App deployed to [Firebase](https://recordly.firebaseapp.com/#/)

##TODO
- Prohibit dupe entries in Firebase backend
- Complete html views for Songs, Artists, Albums
- Implement “Favorites” action/function
- User authentication using JS callbacks
- TDD! Don’t yet know how to unit test with Angular :'(
- Share data between controllers and refactor using Angular services

##Best practices
- No superfluous indentation, return chars
- Add comments when useful
- Commit early and often!
- Screenreader classes in BS forms, etc. for accessibility
