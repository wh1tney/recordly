##Recordly

Recordly will be an application that allows for users to input and store their
record collection. When complete, the user should be able to view their record
collection, view a list of their "favorite" albums and/or songs, etc. Duplicate
albums/songs should not be allowed. They should be able to "favorite" any of
album/song/artist.

The site should have the following functionality:

User login
Search
Views:
- Albums
  - Individual album view with songs
- Artists
- Songs
- Favorites
- Albums
  - Artists
  - Songs
Using any language or framework you prefer, please build an application using
testing and best practices. Make the site have a mix of traditional CGI forms
with page refreshes, as well as at least one each of an AJAX GET and POST (or
some other modification type verb).

Please provide a link for the GitHub repository and deployed url for the
application so that we can see the various portions working.

Please use git as you would if you were working on this in a professional
environment.
